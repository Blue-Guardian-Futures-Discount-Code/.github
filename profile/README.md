## 🚀 What is Blue Guardian Futures?

Blue Guardian Futures is the dedicated futures trading division of Blue Guardian — a proprietary trading firm registered in Saint Lucia with a physical office in Dubai, UAE, and one of the most recognised names in the instant funded account space. While Blue Guardian's main division has built a global reputation for accessible funding starting at just $10 and a scaling path that reaches $4,000,000 in total capital allocation, the Futures division brings that same trader-first infrastructure — fast payouts, clean rules, and an industry-leading profit split — directly into the CME Group, COMEX, NYMEX, and CBOT futures markets.

Unlike prop firms that use intraday trailing drawdowns to stop traders out at the worst possible moment, Blue Guardian Futures operates exclusively on an End-of-Day drawdown model — calculated at the close of each trading session rather than against intraday equity peaks, giving traders the freedom to hold positions through normal intraday volatility without a real-time trailing floor tightening beneath every open trade. The firm offers three distinct funding models — Standard, Guardian, and Instant Guardian — covering everything from structured one-step evaluations to fully instant funded accounts with no profit target required, across account sizes ranging from $50,000 all the way to $150,000. Once funded, traders earn 100% of the first $15,000 in profits, then 90% on all earnings thereafter — with payouts requestable on demand after a minimum funded period of 7 to 14 days depending on account type, and a 24-hour payout processing guarantee backed by Guardian Shield technology that actively protects accounts from breach events in real time.

## 💼 Why Choose Blue Guardian Futures Over Other Prop Firms?

Blue Guardian Futures has established itself as one of the most innovative, payout-reliable, and rule-transparent futures prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **100% profit split on the first $15,000 — then 90% for life** — Blue Guardian Futures pays out 100% of all profits earned up to $15,000 per funded account, meaning the firm takes nothing from initial earnings; after that threshold, traders keep 90% of every dollar generated with no tiered waiting period, no progressive earning requirement, and no percentage withheld for any reason beyond that split
- **End-of-Day drawdown across all account types — never intraday** — the Maximum Drawdown is assessed exclusively at market close using closed position performance rather than unrealised intraday equity; a trade that dips deeply intraday but recovers by close does not impact the drawdown threshold at all, giving traders genuine room to manage volatile positions without a real-time trailing floor punishing normal intraday price action
- **Guardian Shield — active account protection technology** — exclusive to Blue Guardian, Guardian Shield monitors open PnL in real time on funded accounts and automatically closes all positions if floating losses reach 1% to 2% of initial account balance — a soft breach with no account termination, allowing traders to continue trading immediately; this system is specifically designed to prevent the single largest cause of account breaches, which Blue Guardian's own data shows accounts for over 73% of all terminations industry-wide
- **Three funding models for every trader profile** — Standard accounts offer the lowest entry cost with a structured one-step evaluation and 7-day payout eligibility; Guardian accounts provide a no-daily-loss-limit evaluation with no minimum trading days and 14-day payout eligibility; Instant Guardian accounts skip the evaluation entirely, placing traders directly into a funded environment from the moment of purchase with no profit target required to begin earning
- **No minimum trading days on Guardian and Instant Guardian accounts** — while Standard accounts require a 5-day minimum trading period with at least 0.5% profit on each qualifying day, Guardian and Instant Guardian accounts have no minimum trading day requirement whatsoever; traders who hit the profit target quickly are not forced to drag out their evaluation over an arbitrary calendar period before being recognised as passing
- **Evaluation fee fully refunded at fourth payout** — the challenge fee paid to purchase any Blue Guardian Futures evaluation account is fully refunded when the trader receives their fourth payout, making the long-term cost of the evaluation zero for traders who build a consistent funded track record, with the fee only forfeited in the event of a hard breach before reaching that milestone
- **On-demand payout requests after minimum funded period** — after meeting the initial 7-day or 14-day funded eligibility window depending on account type, traders can request withdrawals at any time with no restriction to specific payout calendar dates, bi-weekly windows, or minimum profit thresholds beyond those documented in the account terms
- **24-hour payout processing guarantee** — Blue Guardian Futures commits to processing all approved withdrawal requests within 24 hours, one of the fastest documented payout turnaround commitments in the futures prop space, backed by the firm's own payout infrastructure rather than relying on third-party payment processors for the approval step
- **50% consistency rule during evaluation — 40% once funded** — no single trading day can account for more than 50% of the total profit target during evaluation or more than 40% of total profits used to trigger a funded withdrawal; this rule is clearly documented, consistently enforced, and ap
